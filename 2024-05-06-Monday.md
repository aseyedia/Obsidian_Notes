### 2024-05-06 9:27:07am

Last week, I was trying to set up the [[Internal DSpace Instance Setup Log#2024-05-01 4 24 12pm|when I realized I had installed all of the dependencies with a too-old version of Java.]] I asked Alex just now if it's trivial to reset the VM and he basically said 'no.' So it's going to be easier, I think, to just suck it up and try to uninstall JDK 8 by cleaning up my environment as much as humanly possible and rebuilding all of the dependencies with Java 17.
