Wow. [Looks like I did a lot last week](https://dspace-org.slack.com/archives/C3V628QNN/p1720215840715069?thread_ts=1720207152.337519&cid=C3V628QNN). Damn.

Okay well. Guess I gotta go on with the dang thing. The darn stuff. I feel like a zombie right now. Normally I'm fine with just 5 hours of sleep but right now I am still waking up.

## End of Day Review

I fixed the backend. It was simpler than expected.

Now I'm trying an overly-complicated way of merging the frontend upgrades with the customizations. Basically tomorrow I need to do another dry run, add all of the changes made in the new version, pop the stash and overwrite the files. This was too complicated though. Maybe it's going to make upgrading PEDSpace easier.

Here's the [CGPT Thread](https://chatgpt.com/c/e59b02ae-b27a-46ca-b2f0-54e480762faf).
