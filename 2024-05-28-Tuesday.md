### 2024-05-28 10:24:03am

Okay. I revisited [[Internal DSpace Instance Setup Log#2024-05-28 9 56 10am|DSpace because of the `cron` issue only to find that I can't even `ssh` into it anymore.]] So [I messaged Alex Sharrock about this](https://pedsnet.slack.com/archives/D06UK3WKQMU/p1716906083704989) to see if he had any thoughts or advice.
