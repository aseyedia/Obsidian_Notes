Today, you worked on resolving issues with your DSpace installation and configuration, particularly involving Solr and PostgreSQL. Here's a summary of the activities:

1. **DSpace URL Configuration**: You adjusted the `dspace.server.url` in your DSpace configuration to reflect the correct URL without appending `/server`.
2. **Database Connection Issue**: You encountered and discussed an SQL exception related to a failed database connection. It seemed there might have been confusion with the database connection settings due to hostname usage.
3. **PostgreSQL Configuration**: You added the server's external IP address in PostgreSQL's configuration to allow connections, but faced issues with PostgreSQL not running, which were later resolved by discovering the correct service name to check its status.
4. **Solr Integration**: A major portion of today's session involved addressing a 404 error when trying to access Solr's administrative interface. You followed the DSpace installation guide to configure Solr by copying the necessary Solr cores. However, there was a misconfiguration or issue preventing Solr from working correctly, resulting in a 404 error.
5. **Documentation Discrepancies**: You expressed frustration with discrepancies in the DSpace installation documentation, which led to some confusion. After realizing the documentation version mismatch, you located the correct installation guides for DSpace 7.

Your main focus was troubleshooting these configuration issues to get both PostgreSQL and Solr functioning correctly with DSpace. You plan to recheck configurations, ensure network accessibility, and potentially restart services to apply changes.

**DSpace Installation Issue with Solr Integration**

After a challenging installation process of DSpace 7, an issue arose with integrating Solr. Despite following the instructions to copy Solr cores from the DSpace directory to the Solr installation directory, the Solr server at `http://pedsdspace01.research.chop.edu:8983/solr` returned a 404 error, indicating a possible misconfiguration or an issue with the Solr server itself.

Steps taken to address the issue included:

1. Verifying that Solr was installed and running correctly.
2. Checking Solr's URL and port to ensure they matched the expected configurations.
3. Ensuring that Solr cores were properly copied to the correct directory and confirming the path configurations.
4. Setting the correct file permissions for the Solr directories to make sure that the Solr service had the necessary read/write access.
5. Planning to review Solr logs for any errors or warnings that could indicate what might be causing the 404 error.

The immediate action plan is to recheck all configurations, ensure network accessibility, and potentially restart the Solr service to apply any changes.
