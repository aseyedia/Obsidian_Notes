## Today's Focus

### Work Priority

_Specify your main work task for the day_

- We have a two-hour long speed-dating thing today from 11am to 1pm, with a lunch break, I think. I'm just kidding, of course, it's not speed dating. It's like some sort of employee compatibility thing.
- I need to figure out why I can't reach `solr` on the `dspace` hostname. Is it because of security settings?
