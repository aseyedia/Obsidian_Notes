## Conclusion

*2024-05-21 9:38:30am*

Okay so for now I am waiting for some positive movement/developments.

I just thought I would share some reflections 1 day after:

1. I think a big part of the reason why this took so long is because I was trying to use a self-signed certificate that I generated on the server myself. It shouldn't have caused any problems but, as evidenced by the fact that the production build worked with all "default" config settings (`ssl.conf`, `config.prod.yml`, `local.cfg`), that probably had something to do with it.
2. `angular.json` might have helped the `dev` instance to run but otherwise did not really need to be edited, because, as I alluded to earlier, I didn't need to rebuild `prod` to get it to work.

So the lesson for the future is this: make sure you're using a valid certificate always, and make sure you can get the default settings to work before going in circles for days. I learned a lot but spent too much time on this. Not really time I could have spent on anything else, but time nonetheless.

Based on the detailed project log provided, it's evident that the process of setting up and configuring a DSpace instance involves a series of complex steps, including the installation and configuration of prerequisite software such as Tomcat, PostgreSQL, and Solr, as well as DSpace itself. The log entries highlight several challenges encountered during the setup, including issues with permissions, configuration settings, and the need for adjustments based on the specific versions of DSpace and its dependencies.

One notable challenge was the realization that the installation instructions were not updated for the latest version of DSpace, leading to confusion and the need for adjustments. This underscores the importance of consulting the most current documentation and release notes when working with open-source software.

The process also involved configuring environmental variables, such as `CATALINA_HOME` and `PATH`, and addressing issues related to file permissions and system configurations to ensure that the various components of the DSpace ecosystem could interact correctly. Additionally, the project log mentions the need to configure SSL certificates and troubleshoot SSL-related errors to secure the application.

From the log, it's clear that setting up DSpace is not a straightforward task and requires a good understanding of the underlying technologies, attention to detail, and the ability to troubleshoot and resolve issues as they arise. The experience documented in the log also highlights the value of community support and resources, such as forums and documentation, in navigating the complexities of installing and configuring DSpace.

Given the detailed nature of the project log, a question that arises from this context could be:

**How can the process of installing and configuring DSpace be streamlined to address common challenges such as outdated documentation, configuration errors, and dependency management, ensuring a smoother setup experience for new users?**
