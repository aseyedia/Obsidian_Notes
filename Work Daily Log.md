## [[Work Daily Log|Yesterday's]] EOD Review

![[Work Daily Log#End of Day Review|2024-07-08-Monday > End of Day Review]]

## Log

### 2024-07-09 9:41:27am

Alright I love blowing some time at the beginning of the day working on some personal stuff. Today I made a profile GitHub README.md. I wanna finish it out. I also want to update my Obsidian template repo.

- [ ] Flesh out GitHub Profile README.md ➕ 2024-07-09
- [ ] Update Obsidian Template Repo ➕ 2024-07-09
- [ ] Make an Obsidian workflow for both personal and work-related note-taking. ➕ 2024-07-09

Okay. So basically where I left things off is that I was integrating changes. Let's integrate.

## End of Day Review

This is a nightmare.

```sh
ng generate @angular/core:standalone --path src/themes/PCORnet-custom
```

The above command is supposed to convert my theme into "standalone architecture." Instead, it takes me to an emacs screen where I have no idea what I'm doing.

Otherwise, the upgrade is more-or-less complete for PCORnet, I just need to figure out how to port my frontend theme in. It looks like because I'm not that far along, I could just do it manually, but that's a PITA and it doesn't help me/us when we have to inevitably upgrade in the future.
