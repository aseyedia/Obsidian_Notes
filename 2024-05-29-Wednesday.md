## Log

I just had a meeting where they talked about [[AQL Testing and Optimization|AQL Testing and Optimization]] and basically, what I worked on over the past few days was a total waste of time and no one gives a fuck. PS I should kill myself.

Here's what Lucy said:

> All good! I think the changes could be beneficial moving forward and especially for development to catch some errors. Qiwei & Sahal took a look at it and said it looks good, but mostly we want it to be quick & efficient. Since it is being distributed so soon, I'll probably only be making major changes going forward but if you had any suggestions for the workplan or if you wanted to test it at all, that would be helpful.

I kind of feel like it wasn't my fault because I was given a super broad directive; Jon told me to just "mess around" with the AQL Query 1 repo and see if there are "any suggestions." Okay, I made some suggestions. Oops my suggestions suck ass. Not my fault. I am starting to wonder if I am superfluous.

It also appears that the contractor, Alla, who was brought on to do the frontend stuff? She just disappeared. I saw her on her first day, but then she didn't appear the following Monday, and now it seems like they mentioned she has quit. Weird.

### May-29-2024 12:13pm

Okay I had kind of a tough morning but Jon just offered me full-time for the remainder of my contract to take over Alla's role. That's a huge deal. He even apologized for not being present enough as a boss and I'm like bro you're good. lol. But yeah I think I'm going to take it.

Anyway looks like I squandered my morning again.
